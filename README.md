# README

Assalamu Alaikum!

Welcome to this repository.

I am a non-CS student with a pure business background. But, I feel passionate about ICT, CS, Cyber Security fields.

From being inspired by my passion, I wished to learn the basics of Python programming language.

Rather than for earning, I wished to learn for learning.

I learned from many different sources. And, still learning... 

Here I wanted to keep the files that I made during my learning process.

Referring to the inline comments may be helpful for learners.

The files are named based on the source conducted for that file.

Happy learning!
